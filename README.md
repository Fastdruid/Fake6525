# Fake6525

This was forked from a MOS 6523 TPI (Tri Port Interface) CPLD replacement which has been proved on a 1551.

This itself was a fork of the original go4retro/Fake6523 repo. Code was fixed and HW checked on real 1551 - working good.

The 6525 behaves exactly as a 6523 when in "Mode 0", in Mode 1 it has added interrupts. The hardware is identical. Same pin outs etc. 

In theory this should probably work.
