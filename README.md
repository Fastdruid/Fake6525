# Fake6525

Currently this is a MOS 6523 TPI (Tri Port Interface) CPLD replacement which has been proved on a 1551.

This itself was a fork of the original go4retro/Fake6523 repo. Code was fixed and HW checked on real 1551 - working good.

The intention however as a 6525 is a 6523 with added interrupts to "convert" the 6523 to a 6525. 

No changes have been made as of yet.
